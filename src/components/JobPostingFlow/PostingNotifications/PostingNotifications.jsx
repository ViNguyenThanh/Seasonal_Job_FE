                    <p>
                        Hello! <span className='blue'>SJCP</span> would like to send some notices to employers. To ensure a
                        transparent and efficient job posting process, please follow these guidelines: <br />
                        <br />
                        <span className='black'>1. Each Job Posting must be part of a Job Group</span> ‚Üí Before posting a job, you
                        must first create a <span className='purple'>Job Group</span>. <br />
                        <span className='black'>2. Job Group duration</span> ‚Üí Because this is a short-term seasonal job, the time is
                        <span className='red'> only from 1 day to a maximum of 1 month (30 days)</span>. <br />
                        <span className='black'>3. Create the correct number of Job Postings</span> ‚Üí Each <span className='purple'>Job Group</span> can contain
                        multiple Jobs. Make sure to set the correct number of <span className='dark-red'>Job Postings</span> needed for recruitment. <br />
                        <span className='black'>4. Payment is required before posting a job</span> ‚Üí <br />
                        ‚Ä¢ &#160; When creating a <span className='dark-red'>Job Posting</span>, specify the number of employees to be recruited. <br />
                        ‚Ä¢ &#160; The system will calculate the total payment amount based on the number of employees and the set salary. <br />
                        ‚Ä¢ &#160; Each time you post, <span className='blue'>SJCP</span> will charge <span className='rose-first'>50.000 VND / 1 post</span>,
                        <span className='dark-green'> but for accounts that have paid for the Premium package, this fee will not be charged</span>. <br />
                        &emsp; &#160; Ex: You have <span className='purple'>1 Job Group</span>, including <span className='purple'>2 Jobs</span>: <br />
                        &emsp; &emsp; ‚Ä¢ <span className='blue-lagoon'>&#160; Job 1</span> needs <span className='light-blue'>4 people</span>, salary for 1 person: <span className='orange'>2.000.000 VND</span> <br />
                        &emsp; &emsp; ‚Ä¢ <span className='blue-lagoon'>&#160; Job 2</span> needs <span className='light-blue'>2 people</span>, salary for 1 person: <span className='orange'>3.000.000 VND</span> <br />
                        ‚Üí The amount to be paid in advance will be:
                        <span className='light-blue'> 4</span> <span className='green'>x</span> <span className='orange'>2.000.000</span> +
                        <span className='light-blue'> 2</span> <span className='green'>x</span> <span className='orange'>3.000.000</span> =
                        <span className='light-red'> 14.000.000 (VND)</span> <br />
                        ‚Üí <span className='rose'>If the account is not a Premium account</span>, the total amount to be paid will be:
                        <span className='light-red'> 14.000.000</span> + <span className='rose'>50.000</span> = <span className='crimson'>14.050.000 (VND)</span> <br />
                        {/* <span className='blue'>‚Ä¢ You must pay the full amount and deposit in one transaction before the Job Posting is posted.</span> <br /> */}
                        <span className='warning'>‚ö†Ô∏è</span> <span className='yellow'>Important:  </span> <br />
                        &emsp; ‚Ä¢ &#160; Your <span className='dark-red'>Job Postings</span> will <span className='dark-orange'> only be posted
                        after the payment is completed.</span> <br />
                        &emsp; ‚Ä¢ &#160; Once the payment is made, you will  <span className='red'> not be able to edit the <span className='dark-red'>Job Postings information </span> </span> <br/>
                        &emsp; &emsp; ‚ûú &#160;So please DOUBLE-CHECK all the details before completing the payment. <br />
                        &emsp; ‚Ä¢ &#160; This amount will be temporarily locked when starting the <span className='purple'>Job Group</span>,
                        after the <span className='purple'>Job Group</span> is completed and confirmed by both parties, this amount
                        will be unlocked and then the salary will be paid. <br />
                        <span className='warning'>üö©</span> <span className='red'>Note: </span> <br />
                        &emsp; ‚Ä¢ &#160; After the <span className='dark-red'>Job Postings</span> is approved, <span className='dark-green'>after 7 days </span>,
                        the <span className='purple'>Job Group</span> must have <span className='red'>at least 1 worker </span> whose application has been approved 
                        in a <span className='dark-red'>Job Posting</span> before the <span className='purple'>Job Group</span> can be started. <br />
                        &emsp; ‚Ä¢ &#160; If the <span className='dark-red'>other Job Postings</span> in the <span className='purple'>Job Group </span>
                        <span className='red'>have reached the start date</span> but <span className='red'>no worker</span> has been approved yet, then after the <span className='purple'>Job Group </span>
                        is completed, <span className='blue'>SJCP</span> will refund the corresponding amount of <span className='dark-red'>those Job Postings</span> to you. <br />
